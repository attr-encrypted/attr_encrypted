# attr_encrypted #

## 3.2.0 ##
* Added: Support Rails upto 6.2 and Ruby upto 3.0 (@mvastola)
* Added: `appraisal` gem to organize testing with different versions of dependencies (@mvastola)
* Changed: Outdated version dependencies in `gemspec` (@mvastola)

## 3.1.0 ##
* Added: Abitilty to encrypt empty values. (@tamird)
* Added: MIT license
* Added: MRI 2.5.x support (@saghaulor)
* Fixed: No long generate IV and salt if value is empty, unless :allow_empty_value options is passed. (@saghaulor)
* Fixed: Only generate IV and salt when :if and :unless options evaluate such that encryption should be performed. (@saghaulor)
* Fixed: Private methods are correctly evaluated as options. (@saghaulor)
* Fixed: Mark virtual attributes for Rails 5.x compatibility (@grosser)
* Fixed: Only check empty on strings, allows for encrypting non-string type objects
* Fixed: Fixed how accessors for db columns are defined in the ActiveRecord adapter, preventing premature definition. (@nagachika)

## 3.0.3 ##
* Fixed: attr_was would decrypt the attribute upon every call. This is inefficient and introduces problems when the options change between decrypting an old value and encrypting a new value; for example, when rotating the encryption key. As such, the new approach caches the decrypted value of the old encrypted value such that the old options are no longer needed. (@johnny-lai) (@saghaulor)
